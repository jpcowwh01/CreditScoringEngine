#Credit Scoring Engine

This is a part one demo of using jBPM with Drools, demonstrating the basicks of the rules engine.

To see the demo in action, check out this project, install latest version of maven (currently 3.6.2), and run the following:

`mvn clean test`

You can also edit the drools rule under:

`src\main\resources\rules\credit.drl` 

to expand on interacting with the drools file in MVEL format.

Part two of this demo will go into using the optimizer.
